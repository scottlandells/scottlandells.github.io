                  <p>Donut Delights has been serving C-U with the highest quality donuts and coffees since 1971. Nestled in downtown Urbana, Donut Delights has become a haven for “Gotta have it” breakfast treats. Our donuts are baked fresh twice daily and our coffee’s brewed every fifteen minutes. If you have never been to C-U’s hidden gem, you are missing out. 
                  Donut Delights was started in 1971 by Melvin Furballski, an immigrant baker from the far east coast of Poland. Known far and wide for his delicate pastries, Melvin fled his homeland in search of a better life for his family. In 1970 he landed in New York City and by chance he found an open seat on a bus heading west. When an unexpected mechanical failure forced a three day delay in Champaign, Illinois, Furballski saw the need for a donut shop, so he decided to stay and make a new life for himself in Urbana, Illinois. </p>

                <div><img src="img/cafe.jpg" alt="cafe" id="cafe">
                <div class="column"></div>

                  <p>With only one hundred dollars to
                    his name, he found an abandoned
                    breadshop and within two days
                    he had one of a kind donuts flying
                    off the racks faster than he could
                    bake them and things have never
                    slowed down. Now you can find
                    that same great donut recipe plus
                    dozens more still being made
                    with the same love and care as
                    when Donut Delights first
                    opened.A bakery fire in the
                    mid-1980s destroyed many of the
                    shop's records...but NOT THE
                    RECIPES. While many people
                    might have viewed the fire as an
                    excuse to quit, Melvin instead
                    used it as an opportunity to reconfigure
                    the interior design, allowing
                    him to add the coffee roastery
                    section as well. So when you visit,
                    be prepared for the inviting mix of
                    aromas from fresh-roasted coffee
                    beans and fresh-baked donuts:
                    It's the closest thing to "Breakfast
                    Heaven" anywhere in the C-U
                    area!</p>
